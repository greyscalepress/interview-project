# The Interview Project

This book is a work-in-progress. It gathers transcripts of interviews I have recorded / conducted, as well as notes of events and conferences. 

It has been inspired, among others, by Hans-Ulrich Obrist *Interview Project[^huo]* ("an oral history of contemporary art", running since 1996 with nearly 2000 hours of interviews); by the book *Conversations[^conv]* edited by Constant and Christoph Haag in 2015; by a book by Markus Miessen[^ECE], and some more.

## Principles: 

- conduct interviews
- transcribe (or use online transcription services)
- publish

## Background:

During the 1990s : taped interviews conducted for music fanzines (Cr√©puscule, Transit magazine), with Das Ich, Velvet Acid Christ, Olivier Moreau, Stelarc, Mother Destruction, Zbigniew Karkowski...

More recently: interviews with Libre Graphics Magazine (2011), OSP (in the frame of Aether9 book, 2012), Dave Crossland (2014).
