**Appropriation** (n.)  Appropriation in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them. The use of appropriation has played a significant role in the history of the arts (literary, visual, musical and performing arts). In the visual arts, to appropriate means to properly adopt, borrow, recycle or sample aspects (or the entire form) of human-made visual culture. Notable in this respect are the Readymades of Marcel Duchamp.Source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\hspace{0pt}Appropriation_(art)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_(art))**Blook** (n.)  A blook is printed book that contains or is based on content from a blog.Jarvis, Jeff. 2002. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\hspace{0pt}Blook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blook)**Book Spam**  A variety of spam that takes advantage of print-on-demand book production, which has been growing exponentially between 2006 and 2010. Similar to "content farms" on the web, spam books are mass-produced, either through algorithms or outsourced labor. Content is typically derived from the public domain, or from Wikipedia articles, under an appearance that is mimicking conventions of academic publishing (editor names sporting middle initials, stock imagery cover photos and exorbitant price tags). Using those techniques, BiblioBazaar has engineered 270'000 titles in 2009, while VDM Publishing generated 500'000 unique titles from aggregated Wikipedia content in 2011.  Another form of book spam consists in publishing copycat books, with titles that are "nearly identical" to international bestsellers – e.g., "Thirty-Five Shades of Grey" by J. D. Lyte, or "Fifty-Thousand Shades Of Grey" by S. C. Ashen.Source: [http://ms-studio.net/notes/le-grand-archivage/](http://ms-studio.net/notes/le-grand-archivage/)**Book Sprint**  A Book Sprint brings together a group to produce a book in 3-5 days. There is no pre-production and the group is guided by a facilitator from zero to published book. The books produced are high quality content and are made available immediately at the end of the sprint via print-on-demand services and e-book formats.  The term ‘Book Sprint’ was coined by Tomas Krag and the Book Sprint method was founded by Adam Hyde. In the first sprints held under this term Tomas brought together a small group of people for a week to plan the outline for a book and then the group worked remotely on developing and editing the contents over a period of 6-9 months.Source: [http://www.booksprints.net/about/](http://www.booksprints.net/about/)**(The Aesthetic of) Bookishness**  “What I’m calling ‘the aesthetic of bookishness’ is a trend in novels published since 2000. It is not limited to American or even Anglophone novels, and, I will argue, it is more than a just a coincidence: it is an emergent literary strategy that speaks to our cultural moment. These novels exploit the power of the print page in ways that draw attention to the book as a multimedia format, one informed by and connected to digital technologies. They define the book as an aesthetic form whose power has been purposefully employed by literature for centuries and will continue to be far into the digital age.”Pressman, Jessica. 2009. “The Aesthetic of Bookishness in Twenty-First-Century Literature.” [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/\hspace{0pt}spo.act2080.0048.402](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.act2080.0048.402).**CodeX**  “*Codex*, derived from the Latin *caudex* (meaning “trunk of a tree”) even happens to contain the English word *code*, which will be central to the future of reading in a variety of ways. The things we’ll be reading in the future will not only involve a lot of programming; they’ll also require readers to decode complex, multilayered experiences and encode their own ideas as contributions in a variety of creative ways. Since standard printed books are technically codices, we propose (with significantly more trepidation) to distinguish our variant with one of those annoying midword capitals: *codeX*, to remind us that these new things involve experience, experimentation, expostulation … you know, all those X things.”Finn, Ed; Eschrish, Joey. “The Word *E-Book* Should Be Replaced With *CodeX*”. *Slate*.

Within the broad category of electronic literature are several forms and threads of practice, some of which are:
* Hypertext fiction and poetry, on and off the Web* Kinetic poetry presented in Flash and using other platforms* Computer art installations which ask viewers to read them or otherwise have literary aspects* Conversational characters, also known as chatterbots* Interactive fiction* Novels that take the form of emails, SMS messages, or blogs* Poems and stories that are generated by computers, either interactively or based on parameters given at the beginning* Collaborative writing projects that allow readers to contribute to the text of a work* Literary performances online that develop new ways of writing

March 2012. "Dancing The Flip-Flop”. [http://www.robinsloan.com/\hspace{0pt}note/flip-flop/](http://www.robinsloan.com/note/flip-flop/)**Grey literature**  Grey literature is informally published written material (such as reports) that may be difficult to trace via conventional channels such as published journals and monographs because it is not published commercially or is not widely accessible.The identification and acquisition of grey literature poses difficulties for librarians and other information professionals for several reasons. Generally, grey literature lacks strict bibliographic control, meaning that basic information such as author, publication date or publishing body may not be easily discerned. Many of the problems of accessing grey literature have decreased since the late 1990s as government, professional, business and university bodies have increasingly published their reports and other official or review documents free on the World Wide Web. The impact of this trend has been greatly boosted since the early 2000s by the growth of major search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing. Grey reports are thus far more easily found online than they were, and at radically lower cost, at least in the immediate aftermath of their publication.Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature**New Aesthetics**  The New Aesthetic is an artistic movement. It is sometimes described as physical versus virtual, or the tension between humans and machines. Its major visual emblems include pixelated images, Photoshop glitches, gradients, render ghosts, and, yes, animated GIFs. Data visualization, like an elaborate Venn diagram, can fall under the New Aesthetic umbrella, as can graphic information, like a Google Maps screengrab. Strategically placing marks on a human face, so a machine can't recognize it as a face, is an act of New Aestheticism. Another popular trend: Photos of people taking photos.Source: http://gizmodo.com/5901405/what-is-the-new-aesthetic**Performative Publication**  “[A publication in which] the mode of publication performs one of the central ideas the text itself seeks to articulate and explore."Christopher Long. 2013. Source: [http://www.cplong.org/\hspace{0pt}2013/07/\hspace{0pt}performative-publication/](http://www.cplong.org/2013/07/performative-publication/)**Print on Demand**  Print on demand (POD) is a printing technology and business process in which new copies of a book (or other document) are not printed until an order has been received, which means books can be printed one at a time. While build to order has been an established business model in many other industries, "print on demand" developed only after digital printing began, because it was not economical to print single copies using traditional printing technology such as letterpress and offset printing. In 2009, a million new titles were released via POD in the US, more than three times the amount of titles released through traditional publishing.Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_on_demand**Post-Digital**  “A condition in which digital technology is no longer new media; and where "new media" is no longer by definition digital.”Cramer, Florian. 2014. Source: [https://twitter.com/\hspace{0pt}florian_cramer/\hspace{0pt}status/\hspace{0pt}474683019002130433](https://twitter.com/florian_cramer/status/474683019002130433)**Publication**  "not just the production of books, but the production of a public. This public, which is more than a market, is created through physical production, digital circulation, and social gathering. Together these construct a space of conversation which beckons a public into being.”Publication Studio. Source:  [http://www.publicationstudio.biz/\hspace{0pt}about/](http://www.publicationstudio.biz/about/)**Privishing**  Privishing (private publishing) is a recently coined term for publishing a book in such a small amount, or with such lack of marketing, advertising or sales support from the publisher, that the book effectively does not reach the public. The book, while nominally published, is almost impossible to obtain through normal channels such as bookshops, often cannot be special-ordered and will have a notable lack of support from its publisher, including refusals to reprint the title. A book that is privished may be referred to as "killed". Depending on the motivation, privishing may constitute breach of contract, censorship, or good business practice (e.g., not printing more books than the publisher believes will sell in a reasonable length of time).Source: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\hspace{0pt}Publishing#Privishing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing#Privishing)**Relational Publishing**  Relational publishing is preoccupied with publishing's effects, extending beyond the form of the publishing object and its attendant meanings and cultural symbolism. It is concerned with performance or use, not as the natural result of some intended functionality but rather in the realm of behavior and uncontrollable consequences.Source: TRAUMAWIEN, February 2014. http://traumawien.at/stuff/relationalpub**Robopoetics**  “A condition whereby machines write literature meant to be read by other machines, bypassing a human readership entirely.”Kenneth Goldsmith paraphrasing Christian Bök in Goldsmith, Kenneth. 2011. *Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age*. New York: Columbia University Press.Bök, Christian. “The Piecemeal Bard Is Deconstructed: Notes Toward a Potential Robopoetics,” Object 10: Cyberpoetics (2002), [http://ubu.com/papers/\hspace{0pt}object/03_bok.pdf](http://ubu.com/papers/object/03_bok.pdf); accessed June 19, 2009.**Technotext**  “Literary works that strenghten, foreground, and thematize the connections between themselves as material artifacts and the imaginative realm of verbal/semiotic signifiers they instantiate open a window on the larger connections that unite literature as a verbal art to its material forms.” Hayles, Katherine N. 2002. *Writing Machines*.
