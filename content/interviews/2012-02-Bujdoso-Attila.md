# Meeting with Attila Bujdosó

February 2012

Attila Bujdosó writes:

“This year again I am participating the great Lift conference. It is one of the most  exciting and inspiring events in Europe, so I am happy to be back. (...)

Funnily I met Manuel Schmalstieg, the originator of the wonderful concept wiki-sprint, which we adopted last year when organizing McLuhan wikisprint[^1] at Kunsthalle Budapest. Somehow he discovered that I’m in town, and contacted to meet up for a beer. He showed me a tiny-cute bar, La Petite Reine, and we had a nice discussion about wikipedia art projects, speculative wikipedia entries, and generally what we do.”
