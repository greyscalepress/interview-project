# Designing a Libre Font Specimen Book

A talk delivered at Libre Graphics Meeting, 12th April 2013, Medialab Prado, Madrid.

**Manuel Schmalstieg** — Thanks for having me here, and I'm very glad to follow this presentation by Nathan Willis (...), because what I will tell you about is also a project that was a sprint. 

It happened in one week, in five days, it happened a bit less than two months ago, and it was a workshop that I directed. This workshop was about producing, designing a specimen book with libre / open source fonts. 

What is a specimen book and why do we need a specimen book?

If you design a project with type -- be it a book, or a magazine, or a website -- one of the really first steps you have to attack is to find the good font, that will match the content and that will work. This is an important step, and it can take a lot of time, because there are many good fonts that you may want to use.

It's a very psychological, personal thing to find the appropriate font for a certain text, for a certain story or narration. It's not simply about beautiful letter shapes. Actually, when you read a story, or an article, or an interview, you don't want to see beautiful letters, but you want to go into the text. The font has to become transparent. It has to become invisible.

It will be very dependent on the subject, on the language also. The texture of type changes with different languages. It can have a kind of temperature. A font can be sharp, or thick. Fast, or slow. 

For that, already centuries ago, since we have type, producers of typefaces have done specimen sheets. Here is a very old example by the great William Caslon. 

We can see here a pattern that we use, still, nowadays. A specimen sheet nowadays on Google Web Fonts looks very, very similar to this. You have different weights, you have short paragraphs, different sizes showcasing all the different cuts.

There is some sample text, which should not be too distracting. Here it is in Latin. Here is a bit closer look. In a very small space, the type producer wants to show you everything that font can do. Also, since he is a font producer, he wants to sell the fonts. So there are sometimes conflicting interests with those specimens. 

((On Screen: The FontBook by FontFont))

This is a very well-known book by a typographist during the last decades, the great "FontBook" by FontFont, which has hundreds and hundreds of fonts over those pages. Each font has a few lines showcasing the letters, the glyphs. Short paragraphs of four lines, which is actually very little to judge how the font will render on a whole page of a book.

For me, this was always very frustrating. It was like if you would be a musician, and try to select a sound from a sound library, but you have to listen to 20 sounds at the same time, which makes it very hard to concentrate.

For a strange reason, they stopped producing the book recently. Apparently, print is too expensive. They made an iPad app, so you cannot actually test those fonts on paper -- which, for me, when you make a paper project, is essential because it works completely different than on screen. 

There is another interesting font specimen collection, the "Free Font Index" by Hans Lijklema. It gathers lots of free fonts, but doesn't make a distinction between free and Libre, which is an important point. It also puts many fonts on a limited number of pages, which is not always that useful. And it juxtaposes fonts that may not match entirely in terms of style. 

I think those books are useful. They show you many different fonts. But they have some issues: too little space for a font, always the same "lorem ipsum" repeating all the time, so it starts to be quite annoying and distracting at some point.

Then, another category that appeared recently is print-on-demand books made by independent type producers. This one is made by Radim Peško, a young Czech designer. Another one is made by Jean-Baptiste Levée, a famous French font type designer. 

We can see that they have one thing in common, they love to show the fonts very, very big, so you can appreciate the beauty of the curves and of the glyphs, which is very nice and impressive, but for many use cases, like doing books or magazines, it's really not useful. You have too little paragraph size text, too much big type. 

The logical thing to do, if you work with Libre fonts, is to do your own specimen book. There are lots of open source fonts. You have print on demand technology, so just do it!

This would be extremely expensive if you would want to make your own printed specimen book with commercial fonts. You would have to be really rich. But now, today, it is possible to do. 

I had that idea in mind one year ago. It was clear to me that this had to be a collaborative project, not one person sitting for months doing it, but rather a book sprint, a group of 5-10 people gathering and doing it. 

I started to pitch a bit and I talked about it at the latest RMLL conference in Geneva in summer 2012. I thought it would be a really, really good idea to do that with design students. I managed to get a gig at the Design Department at HEAD Geneva. I had a workforce of 12 students to work for one week on that project. 

We established some rules. To use exclusively Libre fonts, that allow any type of the Four Freedoms. To focus on body text, text that can be used for long form. And to make the book as open as we can, which means: sharing the sources, documenting everything, using an open format. That were the main three bullet points.

The first step was that the students had to produce a standardized specimen layout. This involved a lot of research during the first two and a half days, with many different approaches, different formats, different graphic attempts. Lots of discussions, lot of criticism.

I had a pragmatic approach, I simply wanted to display paragraphs of text that looked close to what we usually see in books. The students were very focused on perfect harmony, breathing space, white space, and so on. Here's was what they achieved and agreed upon, in the end. It was a mutual compromise.

The next thing that was needed, in parallel, was an appropriate source text. When you design a specimen, you need to have some sample text, something to put on the page. This is a tricky choice as well.

We looked at what other specimen books did. We studied the competition. What inspired us a lot was this little book, *Type Now*, by Fred Smeijers, a great Dutch type designer. The book has about 20 pages of specimens showcasing his own fonts. What is interesting is that it's not always the same sentence repeating, but it's one text that flows through those 20 pages.

It's actually a dialogue about the production of fonts, which was written in the 16th century in French by Christophe Plantin. It works very well – you can study the fonts, but it also feels like a live, real text.

So we were looking for a real text, a real narrative. It had to be in the public domain, of course, because we want the book to be freely distributable. It had to be French, because, as we said, language influences the texture. 

We found that book, "L'Ève Future," a pre-science-fiction novel from the 19th century, by Villiers de L'Isle Adam. Thomas Edison is the main character. The story is something that influenced, later, "Metropolis" and "Bladerunner," a female artificial human. It was published more than 100 years ago, the author died in 1889. It is in public domain in most countries. 

Now, the word count: it was quite a lot (85'388), so we had to check if it was feasible. We divided by the number of people (12), estimated the number of words per specimen (500): about 15 specimens per person, may be a bit more... Doable! 

So, the real sprint started, and it was a lot of work. On the little sticky notes, those are the names of the fonts, which are labeled by color for *serif*, *sans*, and *mono*.

The students also designed some personal, creative specimens. Some of them had to be dropped, because Amazon's print-on-demand proofer didn't accept them. The result, the part that worked, is that the book exists. You can purchase it online. It is a physical book, and there is a copy here and a few others, please have a look at it. [laughs] 

It's really useful, I think, honestly. The sources have been shared. I managed to get all the students into GitHub and participate, commit, and so on.

They had some live interaction with some of the designers of the fonts, which is really important. They had to handle the communication. There was a debate internally in the school, about if we can actually publish it or not.

Shortcomings and failures: the proprietary workflow broke the ambition of doing it in Scribus. I learned something from that, which is: I thought *“I will let them do just freely what they want at the beginning and then, at some moment, I will teach them to do it in Scribus”*, which doesn't work.

It has to be decided from the beginning very strictly. Otherwise, under time pressure you will fail. That was a big lesson for me. 

I wrote down some analysis that can be interesting if you want to do similar workshops. 

Conclusion: get the book, or have a look at it. Do your own version of it. Improve it. Collaborate. Thanks!
