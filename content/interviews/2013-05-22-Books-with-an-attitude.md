# Books with an Attitude

From 22 May until 31 May, 2013, the Libre Graphics Research Unit presents *Books with an attitude*, an exhibition of printed books made with Libre digital tools. This exhibition includes Libre bookdesign and typography from all over Europe, demonstrating how content, aesthetics and Libre tools can play together.

Location: Maus Hábitos, Porto  
Exhibition design and curation: Manufactura Independente (Porto)  

**Manuel Schmalstieg** — Thank you, Ricardo, for that introduction. Thank you for having me here. Thank you Femke for the invitation. It's a big pleasure to introduce, to celebrate this opening of the exhibition. And most importantly, of a new library, that has been assembled by Ana and Ricardo. It is a little library, but a very important one. It consists of books made with F/LOSS, Free/Libre and Open Source tools.

What does this mean? Let's think first about what is actually a book nowadays. Is it a decorative object? Is it a tool? Or is it a vehicle for an idea? Or is it something like what Elisa is holding right now in her hand, for instance?

[laughter]

Does it matter *how* the book has been made? It isn't actually the content that is historically the main feature of a book? The cover is important, of course, in order to sell. Then maybe some people throw the dust jacket away, because they just prefer to hold it naked, without an image. 

Traditionally, we think rather about the message, the content. A novel written by Tolstoy, will it be different if it has been typeset on a Gutenberg printer, or on a Linotype machine? Or in the mainstream commercial type setting software of the moment? Or on some underground tool written by the author himself? Does it make a difference? Does it make a difference if you cannot actually see it? Maybe.

For instance, in an apple – can we see if it contains genetically modified organisms or not? We cannot see it, maybe it will look even nicer. Will it make a difference if you eat it? Probably not, scientifically... but who knows? 

With books, it could be the same. Details matter, maybe unconsciously. For typography freaks, the typeface of a book will matter a lot. You will read the novel completely differently if it has been typeset in *sans* or in *serif*. 

The word spacing also makes a difference. For school children, the word spacing is very important. They will learn easier if words have more visible separations. Different software tools do the word spacing differently. They do the hyphenation differently. So, maybe it matters a lot. 

Actually, to know that, we have to look at the books, and we have to compare them. I think when you started doing this library, you didn't really know how it would fit together. It's like when you invite a lot of friends, a lot of people. Friends who don't know each other. You put them in a room, and maybe they will get along and have a good party, or maybe they won't really talk to each other. 

We have to read a little bit, and check out this library to see if it makes sense. If there are common trends, or if it's just random. The interesting thing, if you look at it... [makes a move like preparing to unwrap to library, then stops] ...I will do it after.

[laughter]

**Manuel Schmalstieg** — You will see that there are very, very different books. Novels in many different languages, like in Flemish. Mathematic books, comics. With a lot of different intents, like *made to entertain* or *made exactly not to entertain*. Informative books, or books with disinformation. For some of them, the FLOSS-y aspect of creating them is fundamental and completely part of the layout, like in many works of the OSP team, of which two representatives are here.

Like the *Aether9* book, where archives have been parsed and transformed by the software that was custom written. Or the recent work [by OSP] for the Balsamine theatre, of which which we see here a very fresh example, where code was written to create a layout that could not have happened otherwise.

Other interesting works may look like an ordinary, classical book, following typesetting rules of centuries ago. But they were written in a *book sprint* in five days, through FLOSS software such as booki. Elisa[^Elisa] can tell you more about it.

[^Elisa]: Elisa De Castro Guerra : Présidente de Flossmanuals francophones, facilitatrice de BookSprints et graphiste utilisant les logiciels libres. 

**Elisa De Castro Guerra** — The process of a book sprint is to write a book in five days. Some people here have participated in book sprints. The books are written collaboratively. The first day is used to establish the structure, the next three days people write, and the last day is for proofreading the book.

**MS** — There is one example here of the FLOSS Manuals ecosystem: *Collaborative Futures*. There is another book that [Elisabeth Nesheim] participated in, that was also written through a hybrid collage system that transformed it, written by Brendan Howell. 

There is a book that is made from Wikipedia articles that were parsed and compiled, and that was probably written by 500 or maybe by 1,000 people. There are many other examples, but I will stop here.

[laughter]

**Elisabeth** — No further ado.

**MS** — Let's have a look.
