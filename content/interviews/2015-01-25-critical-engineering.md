On critical engineering

Interview avec Gordan Savičić

MS: Keyword: Critical Engineering. 

Gordan Savičić: In a way, at that time between 2005 and 2010, we (Julian, Danija and me), we noticed a shift in the way our work has been perceived, by institutions, festivals etc.

It was shown in the context of this umbrella of "New Media" - ars electronica festival etc. But we noticed that there are sort of sub-fields of New Media popping up. Sometimes, New Media is just trying to immerse the viewer, for instance by having 360 projections, or playing with sound. We found that there is a missing link, in a way that computation is challenging our role within society. As an artist working with recent technology, to provoke new questions around the way network technology is used in our everyday life.

Some project were being asked "what is this, what kind of projects are those?". While working in our studio Weise7, in Berlin ... when we made that exhibition "Archive: The Weise7 Incompatible Laboratory", we noticed a strong red line inbetween all the projects, that tried to investigate, to challenge these questions... and also to communicate how technology is being used, and can be subverted. What all the pieces had in common was that they were "functional" - they were neither documentation, neither video - they were working, in real time. 

As an example *Packet Bridge*, that I did together with (((BanXiung))). It's an installation using 14 different WiFi routers. And it's trying to send *beacon frames* - standard WiFi packages sent out by a router, which contains it's name and other information. We tried to capture that radiomagnetic information, and to teleport it to another place. 

And what happened by accident: it was exposed at Haus of Kulturen der Welt: you see all the WiFi networks. If you use GoogleMaps or other services... When you popped up your phone and looked for local restaurants, you were shown those of the Neuköln area, instead of Berlin Mitte.

This was quite impressive, because people have seen this geo-hijack on their own device. They could see it on their real telephone.

MS: that was in the 200s... before Edward Snowden. Do you think the situation has evolved, has the communication evolved between hacker communities, the media art, the education system?

**GS:** Sometimes I am optimistic, there are more synergies, in the communication between that open source hacker movement, and institutions. Sometimes I am pessimistic, I see two fields working completely independently of each other, ignoring each other ... art institutions are neglecting - theoretically they accept all these challenges we are facing, but on a practical level they are lagging behind. And then again, certain events like the Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, are far more interesting to listen and visit, than certain theoretical discourses.

We shouldn't neglect critical theory, but sometimes it's missing the link to the real world. For instance the revelations by Snowden, they triggered an avalanche of public protest, of data journalism, of research being done. So in a way, we triggered new discourses, there are new fields of discussion, there is more awareness. But we stay in a very superficial level. 

By nature, we are using more and more technology, which is more and more invisible, and we are more and more illiterate. We, also in the manifesto, were ironically. It's a big claim. By the usage of our tools - if you are using open source RT... there is a certain affordance, a constraint that you are forced to communicate. This is ongoing discourse.

[^literacy]: "The Critical Engineer raises awareness that with each technological advance our techno-political literacy is challenged."

In the work that is done by your students at MediaDesign, do you see ... There has been

True: Felicien is a very interesting case. He has Julien as his tutor. He has ... he really tried, with the Citizen Blackbox project, to put an emphasis on the communication. There was a documentation video. The installation view of the project was quite impressive. The project itself communicates all those topics we are discussing - even though it will not be overwhelmingly used by thousands of people, the idea of the potential is already quite powerful. Strategy of Flooding the network. 

The first point: "*The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.*" - when we were writing this, it was almost the Zeitgeist ... things like AirBnb and Uber were not quite there, but were about to come. 

Those disruptive systems, out of a sudden they are everywhere. Those data points, being part of this large network. They are really shaping the way we interact, the way we move, the way we travel. Our society has seen the danger of this.
