# On critical engineering

Interview with Gordan Savičić

Gordan Savičić is a co-author of the Critical Engineering Manifesto. During 2016-17, he works in Geneva, where he coordinates the Media Design department at HEAD Geneva. In January 2017, we decided to meet over lunch break.

**MS:** Keyword: *Critical Engineering.* You nailed that term in the Manifesto published between 2011-14. Can you put that term in it's original context?

**Gordan Savičić:** In a way, at that period of time between 2005 and 2011, we (Julian Oliver, Danja Vasiliev and me) noticed a shift in the way our work has been perceived, by institutions, festivals etc.

It was shown in the context of this umbrella of "New Media Art" - in art museums, at the Ars Electronica festival, etc. But we noticed that there were sub-fields of New Media popping up. Sometimes, New Media is just trying to immerse the viewer, for instance by using 360-degree projections, surround sound, augmented reality, VR... We found that there is a missing link: an art form that examines how computation is challenging our role within society. As an artist working with recent technology, we want to provoke new questions around the way network technology is being used in our everyday life.

We came up with certain observations. We noticed that some projects were triggering those questions: "what is this, is this now a hacker piece? a hacker project with a design aspect? with an offensive video to communicate an idea? what kind of projects are those?". While working in our studio Weise7, in Berlin, we made that exhibition "Archive: The Weise7 Incompatible Laboratory", and we noticed a strong red line inbetween all the projects. They tried to investigate, to challenge these questions, and also to communicate how technology can be subverted. What all the pieces had in common was that they were quite "functional" - they were neither documentation, neither video. They were working, in real time. 

As an example, *Packetbridge*[^packetbridge], that I did together with Bengt Sjölen. It's an installation using 14 different WiFi routers. It's trying to send *beacon frames*, standard WiFi beacon packages sent out by a router, which contains it's name and other information. We tried to capture that radiomagnetic information, and to teleport it to another place. We did an "exchange".

And what happened by accident: it was exhibited at Haus of Kulturen der Welt, and all of the sudden, you would see all the WiFi networks that are technically located at our studio, which was 5km away. And If you used GoogleMaps or other location-based services, they redirected you, you were flying back and forth. Because your smartphone's geolocalisation depends on WiFi networks. So when you popped up your phone and looked for local restaurants, you were shown those of the Neuköln area, instead of Berlin Mitte.

This was quite impressive, because people have seen this geo-hijack on their own device. They could experience it on their real telephone.

**MS:** That was in the 2000s... in the period between 9/11 and Edward Snowden. In the zeros.

**GS:** Yes, in the void.

**MS:** Do you think the situation of media art has evolved - has the communication evolved between hacker communities, the media art field, and the education system?

**GS:** Sometimes I am optimistic: there are more synergies, in the communication between that open source hacker movement, and institutions. Sometimes I have a pessimistic view, I see two fields working completely independently of each other, ignoring each other. The art institutions, theoretically they accept all these challenges we are facing – but on a practical level they are lagging behind. And then again, certain events like the Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg, are far more interesting to listen and visit, than certain theoretical discourses.

We shouldn't neglect critical theory, but sometimes it's missing the link to the real world. For instance the revelations by Snowden, they triggered an avalanche of public protest, of data journalism, of research being done. So in a way, we triggered new discourses, there are new fields of discourse, there is more awareness. But we stay on a very superficial level. 

By nature, we are using more and more technology, which is getting less and less visible. We are getting more and more illiterate! That's also what we were provocatively claiming in the manifesto: 

> *The Critical Engineer raises awareness that with each technological advance our techno-political literacy is challenged.* 

That's quite a big claim. To what extent can we ensure that this literacy is given? By the usage of our tools - if you are using open source RTOS - there is a certain affordance, a constraint that you are forced to communicate, to be transparent about the tools you use. By nature, this gives you a level of literacy. That's the point of Linux and Open Source. You are the user, but at the same time you can fix it, if you want. How far we can still apply this notion is challenged every day, by new services appearing, which are more and more centralized, which exploit our data. This is ongoing discourse, and we won't step out of that for quite some years.

**MS:** In the work that is done by your students at MediaDesign, do you see new ways of approaching those issues? I think there has been a link between the Critical Engineering idea, and the work of Félicien Goguey[^felicien].

[^felicien]: See http://felicien.io/

**GS:** True! Felicien is a very interesting case. He has worked with Julien Oliver as his tutor. He has really tried to push the work of Critical Engineering further into other fields of interest, into art museums and design events. With the *Citizen Blackbox*, he really tried to put an emphasis on the communication of the project. All the steps were documented quite well. There was a a very clear, well directed video. The installation view of the project itself was quite impressive. What I find interesting, is that the project itself communicates all those topics we are discussing - surveillance, counter-surveillance, strategies. Even though the *Citizen Blackbox* will not be overwhelmingly used by thousands of people, it shows a potential future. The idea of the potential is already quite powerful. Just by setting up a small PiComputer, you become an author, an administrator of what is happening on the network. By obfuscating your traffic, and implanting fake messages, you become part of that strategy of flooding the network. 

GD: A last comment. Let me read the first item of the manifesto: 

> *The Critical Engineer considers Engineering to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.*

Ahen we were writing this, it was almost the Zeitgeist. Things like AirBnb and Uber were not quite there, but were about to come, about to enter our society. 

Out of a sudden, those disruptive systems are everywhere. Your neighbour is renting her appartment on AirBnb, your step-brother is driving for Uber. Those data points, being part of this large network. They are really shaping the way we interact, the way we move, the way we travel. Our society has seen the danger of this.
