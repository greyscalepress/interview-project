Spine Width Calculation:        
Cream paper: multiply page count by 0.0025"

Bleed settings:    
.125" bleed (on each side)

- Minimum Cover Width: Bleed + Back Cover Trim Size + Spine Width + Front Cover Trim Size + Bleed
- Minimum Cover Height: Bleed + Book Height Trim Size + Bleed

### Safe Zone

Text and images must be at least .125" inside the trim lines.

### The spine of your book

Allow for 0.0625" variance on either side of the fold lines for your cover. For example, if your spine width is 1", your text should be no wider than 0.875". Because of this variance, avoid hard edges or lines that end on the fold line.

For books with 130 pages or less, we strongly recommend a blank spine. Blank spines are required for books with less than 101 pages. 

### Barcode

When your files go through the review process, our system will place your ISBN barcode in a 2" by 1.2" white box in the lower right-hand corner of your book's back cover.

If you choose to provide and place your own barcode, be sure it is a high-resolution image. The barcode can be located on the back or front cover of your book, at a recommended size of 2" wide by 1.2" tall.


## Spine Calculation

## Full cover surface (including bleed):    
height: 6.8750 (+ 0.25 bleed = 7.125")    
width: 4.25 + 0.3 + 4.25 = 8.8 (+ 0.25 bleed = 8.25")

**80 pages:**    
Spine width: 0.2
Cover width: 4.25 + 0.2 + 4.25 = 8.7 (+ 0.25 bleed = 8.95")    
start of right page: 4.25+0.2 = 4.45

**120 pages:**
Spine width: 0.3 inch
Cover width: 8.8 inch
With bleed: 9.05 inch
Start of right page: 4.55 inch 

**139 pages:**    
Spine width: 0.3475 inch
Cover width: 8.8475 inch
With bleed: 9.0975 inch
Start of right page: 4.5975 inch

**144 pages:**    
Spine width: 0.36 inch
Cover width: 8.86 inch
With bleed: 9.11 inch
Start of right page: 4.61 inch

**145 pages:**

Spine width: 0.3625 inch
Cover width: 8.8625 inch
With bleed: 9.1125 inch
Start of right page: 4.6125 inch

**158 pages:**    
width: 4.25 + 0.395 + 4.25 = 8.895 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.145")    
start of right page: 4.25+0.395 = 4.645

**187 pages:**    
Spine width: 187 * 0.0025 = 0.4675    
Cover width: 4.25 + 0.4675 + 4.25 = 8.9675 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.2175")    
Right page begins at: 4.25 + 0.4675 = 4.7175

**275 pages:**    
Spine width: 275 * 0.0025 = 0.6875    
Cover width: 4.25 + 0.6875 + 4.25 = 9.1875 (+ 0.25 bleed = 9.4375)     
Right page begins at: 4.25 + 0.6875 = 4.9375
